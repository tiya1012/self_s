1,You guys ever watch a cartoon like adventure Time and fall extremely deep into the stories and realize that the stories that the show tells are more interesting than your life... Or that the characters have more personality. Like is it just me? I fall in love with the plot and I'm emotionally drained but in a good way but then at the end I just wanna die thinking how sick it'd be to not be alive or just be in somewhere where I'm appreciated and have friends.,0
2,"Is it? Successful people are usually strong physically and mentally, and I am neither.",1
3,"I hate myself, i hate everything I am. I wish I didn't. Or maybe I really don't. Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore. I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone. I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist. I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes. I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here. Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die. Why don't I get to be normal? Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger? What did I do to deserve this? Is it because I exist? Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment. I had to be cursed to live a life where I wake up everyday hating myself more and more and more till the white noise becomes a ringing that becomes banging in my head screaming ""YOU ARE WORTHLESS"" in a mask of my own voice. I just want to be free of this curse.",1
4,I really don't know what to do all I want to do right now is just sit alone with no one around me and just cry like why does life have to be this terrible why and why did this have to happen to me why am I only so dumb so stupid and just useless I don't want to be like this i hate it but i don't know what to do,1
5,"I know this is cliches being tired and unable to sleep. I‚Äôm unwell, and I can‚Äôt sleep because of this horrible headache and rating thoughts. I know it‚Äôs a typical depression symptoms. It just really sucks, I‚Äôm sure most of you can relate.",0
6,"Hi guys i really really want to die but every time i want to do it i think about all the people who would be sad about me killing myself. I'm 23 *5 ft 7 * Receding hair * Gotten ugly (used to be very handsome and have women constantly flirt with me) * I got fired from my job * I've destroyed my brain through abusing internet/video games - can no longer think anymore. * I've blown all my money on gambling and prostitutes * I have a terrible OCD/body dismorphia problem that makes me obsessed with working out / eating healthy (to the point that it is damaging my life + * This has made me lost the majority of my friends) * I've never had a gf * i'm also pretty bad socially, often quiet and shy (Social anxiety) I want to just kill myself Everyday I have thoughts saying just do it, do it, i want to die. Just do it. But it's so hard for me. e.g. i have a 13 year old cousin (Single child) who looks up to me and thinks i'm the boss. If i kill myself how would he feel? what am i supposed to do?",1
7,"Tonight I was just thinking about everything I could do to just...stop. But I basically just worked up the little bit of courage I had and I finally called. My anxiety was all over the place and I was constantly having panic attacks about it but, I finally did it. It honestly feels weird to be happy though. Even if I should be feeling proud of myself and all it just feels weird to feel happy. But it felt so good to have someone understand everything I told them, and not just shrug it off and act like it's just because of my age or ""just how I am"" because of my past or anxiety getting to me. It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is. We talked for about 40 minutes and she had a really strong accent but, it was nice. My anxiety eventually faded away, and she helped more than my own family could. I finally feel happy though, and that's all that matters to me right now.",0
8,"These thoughts cause havoc upon my being. Whenever I am not working or sleeping, these thoughts sneak into my consciousness and I would feel futile and pointless - that there is no point of trying anymore because I would never become what or whom I thought I would or could have been. It doesn‚Äôt even matter that I know, heart of hearts, that even without depression I would have been a loser anyway. I am accustomed to blaming it for all the failures, disappointments and misery in life. I guess this justify my expensive bills from my shrink. At least I no longer spent the night tossing and turning in bed thinking. I take my meds and sleep will come.",1
9,"I've been here for eight years. On and off. Don't look here if you want to get better, it's just a place for loners to feel lonelier. Break free through actions, write, read, jump, fly. Fuck this hole...",0
10,This may seem irrelevant to depression but I‚Äôm looking for people who are gamers and have any of the platforms I ask because I‚Äôve been trying to find decent friends and I would like to start trying again I haven‚Äôt had any luck t doesn‚Äôt have to be gaming related just preferred I I just would like to find decent friends,0
11,There is nothing good going on in my life. It's just full of stress and misery. It's becoming clearer by the day what best option is.,0
12,"There's nothing I want to do, I don't enjoy anything anymore, so I just occupy myself with meaningless bullshit to help the time pass. It makes life feel so pointless.",0
13,I better stop being a coward and end it. I‚Äôm scared that a gunshot wound won‚Äôt be fast enough and I don‚Äôt have any bitcoin so I can‚Äôt order the right drugs online. But whatever. Even if it hurts this has to be the year I get the strength,1
14,I wish there was something to fight for other than a paycheck at the end of the month. Life feels so meaningless.,0
15,"How do you talk to people about depression, either about your own or theirs? Do/don'ts?",0
16,I'm boring. I'm not good at socializing and I'm very awkward. I'm replaceable. I'm undesirable. I'm not attractive. I'm retarded. I hate myself so much. I push people away with my insecurities. Fuck I want to die so much right now.,1
17,"I've already broken all of mine. I wanted to start keeping a journal. Nope didn't happen. Wanted to start drawing more, didn't happen either. I've become worse and just lie in bed all day now. I just wanted to become a better person.",1
18,"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to. And I guess if I could sum that up in a word, that's how I feel about myself.",1
19,"I'm really rock-bottom at the moment. I'm seeking therapy, I have great friends and family who I hear from every few days, but no matter what: I feel isolated and I just don't want to bother anyone. Desperate for human contact, feeling included, loved, etc. Is this reasonable? Should I reach out to some friends, even though I am in constant need for that kind of interaction at the moment? I just can't stand being alone.",0
20,So 2018 started and everything feels the same. I'm still depressed. I'm constantly thinking about suicide and I'm steadily losing people whom I can talk to. My life is without purpose. I wish I could end it.,0
21,Don't even have the energy to do that. Why the fuck am I like this. How did I get here. Why the fuck can't I be okay.,0
22,"Look I'm not that depressed. I have mild depression. But . I don't feel alive. I can feel the wind and rain and I can see the hills and the windmills but I can't FEEL them. It's like they aren't there it's like I'm not there. I feel this emotion inside of me that wants to get out but I don't know how. I've been numb for so long and I think a lot of people are they just ignore it. I don't want to ignore it, I want to be alive again. There's this fog in my head that I can't get through. I feel like meds and doctors can't help because they are stuck in the same fog but they just don't know they are. They want to label it different things and give it names but this is something only I can help myself get through. Anyone else feel this way?",0
23,"I don't even know how I feel, I think I might be sad, but even then I usually know when I'm sad. Right now I've just felt numb and disconnected for a few days. I have a girlfriend who loves me, awesome friends, a relatively low stress life, and I even have creative outlets. But, recently (like a week), I haven't been able to write anything, I haven't talked to any of my friends, and I have a ton of trouble even talking with my girlfriend because... I don't even fucking know, I don't know why any of this is like it is. I want to write, I want to write all the time, but I just goddamn can't. I want to talk to my friends and hang out with them but I just fucking don't. I want to be with my girlfriend and hold her and kiss her and tell her I love her but everything I do feels shallow and pointless even when I'm with her. What the fuck is wrong with me? edit: it's fucking 2 am and I'm not sleeping, even though I have work tomorrow at 7. I don't know why, I'm just not getting into bed. I know I should, I know I need sleep, but for some reason I'm just not getting in bed. I'm tired, I'm just fucking not. I don't get any of this.",0
24,It's night and as usual that's when all these horrible thoughts come to my head. I know I'm not a terrible person but I haven't exactly had the best year so I feel kind of overwhelmed right now. I really need to talk to someone ASAP I don't feel good.,0
25,"I'm finally going in for a check up with an actual psychiatrist soon for my depression. I'm researching into the different kinds of antidepressants and found that Wellbutrin seemed best fit for my case except for the issue of it causing a person to become more anxious? Has wellbutrin worsened your anxiety/make you more anxious? I have depressive episodes where I can't get out of bed, feel numb towards emotions, want to be left alone/don't want to talk to people, unproductive. But I also feel like I have high anxiety? But the anxiety usually comes as a result as the unproductiveness (i.e. late/rushed assignments).",1
26,"Btw I'm beyond nervous, I am terrified right now. Lets see what happens today. Hope you all have a good day today!",0
27,you say you want me to be real with you and that I can talk to you about anything but at the same time you keep saying quit being so negative and bringing the mood down,0
28,"all of the years ive been chubby and we had other problems since my mom was depressed (plus other mental ilnesses) now i was diagnosed with mental ilness and he is disappointed because he is afraid i will turn like my mother. Yesterday at night i went to the bathroom which is next to my parents bedroom and he said to my mom about her but then he also included me '' i am disgusted by fat, its disgusted, filthy and dirty i don't even know how to express it to my daughter''. It just broke me, broke me to pieces. I doubt he even loves me, i have seen him looking at me with disappointment when i eat something it's just makes me hate my self more and make me want to kill myself.",1
29,"Hey guys, I've been really distant from people lately, friends and family and everyone really, I've just preferred to be by myself, apart from when I'm with my girlfriend but it's been like this for a few months now. I've gotten inconsistent with training and it's something that I'd usually never skip, I'm very passionate about and I have plenty of motivation for. I procrastinate with college all the time even though I know it'll make life harder for me in the long run and I've left my diet slip. I really want to be the social, healthy, motivated and driven person that I know I can and I used to be, but it almost feels like that person is trapped and being held back inside of me unable to control the me on the outside. I feel lazy and sad and like I'm not a nice person to be around. Maybe these all seem like obvious symptoms of depression, and maybe they seem like they're obviously not symptoms of depression and they're something else, but I just don't know, I'd be really grateful if someone could let me know if they think I should see a doctor about depression or if they think I need to do something else. I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh. Thanks a lot guys, it feels nice to be able to get it all out in the open!",1
30,"I feel like life isn't going anywhere and I don't have goals or ambitions that are attainable right now. Once I get back to work yea I got goals of getting my fiance a place and us having kids but right now it seems so far off and impossible to reach, im also feeling trapped by my thoughts. More so a voice in my head that sounds very familiar to me father's that just tears me down from the inside out when I get down, and then I feel like that me being down all the time is gonna fuck up things with my fiance, she loves me and helps me a ton but I feel like I'm a burden on her and I don't like any of this. I know this is just a rough patch and that things will get better but right now it's hard for me to see that and I just needed to unload thus jumbled mess of thoughts off my chest. I have a better life than a lot of people and I'm gonna be fine it's just these down moments seem endless and it makes me feel stuck.",0
31,"Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night? I've been doing pretty okay during the day, but at night I am almost always suicidal. Yesterday, I cried from 7PM to 1AM and it was completely exhausting. It took everything out of me and I just wanted to end it all. But then, by the morning, I am almost completely fine? Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not? But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again. Other times I just feel completely numb and dissociated and as if I'm floating and living in limbo and just existing but not actually living. Does anyone experience this? How do you deal with it?",0
32,"I feel and felt like this for the majority of my life. I want to do a lot of things but realizing I suck so much at them, I just stop it. It‚Äòs so maddening to feel like a loser. It‚Äòs like people would be better off without me because since I have nothing to contribute. Is it normal to feel like you‚Äòre too stupid to aquire skills?",1
33,"I can't really explain what's up with my mind, but today I sent everyone my final goodbye to them, the way they behaved makes me want to die more, now I am determined to do so",0
34,"Sometimes without even meaning to, I will just sit here and think about the accumulative shit that went on in my childhood that has resulted in this depressed mess. Like, it isn't one thing, but rather a whole string of things that eventually connect when you think back on it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night (posting this at 5:05 am right now)",0
35,"So, I have been thinking of harming myself lately even though it's been a while since I've done it. I've been able to keep myself from harming myself or doing drugs for a while now but something just snapped in recent months that's making me just irritable, impatient, and wanting to spiral out of control again. I just feel like a shell and any kind of physical pain is like breath of fresh air. Anyone else go through something like this? If you got through it, how?",0
36,"Im autistic, with disabilities and unable to go out on my own. I soend most my time alone. I have no family but care workers come a few hours a day to care for me. Sometimes its ok, other times like now I end up crying. The last visitor I have had, other than care staff was 24th December.... I get communication online some... But not to much... And its just not the same as soending time in person. That person has not messaged since. Im missing human contact. Im unsure who really is a friend and who is not. I am so lonely. I feel so unwanted... Any advice welcome",1
37,"I recently started dating my Deaf friend and she opened right up to me about how she had depression and contemplated suicide a few years ago. She says she felt like a burden to the people around her. Having to learn a new language just to talk to her, not listening to her because they don‚Äôt understand her voice, and not wanting to communicate with her at all. We watched a movie the other day at my house and she fell asleep on my chest. I rolled up her sleeve because it was getting caught on my watch, and I saw a massive amount of old scars on her left arm. I pulled her sleeve right down and just thought for a second. I‚Äôve never seen her without a long sleeve shirt or a coat on. Even though I‚Äôve been one of her closest friends for years. She obviously cuts herself, or used to cut herself as the case may be. She has apparently been feeling heaps better recently so thats great, she says she learnt to smile, and that she learnt there are people that care for her. And I believe her. But what if this happens again? What if she has another rough trot? What am I to do, I feel like I won‚Äôt be enough to stop her. Even if she is past this, I‚Äôm worried. Is it normal to be worried?",0

39,"Changed sm this past year. Not really the same person anymore, I used to be this emotional person that let people walk over them but now I am kinda the opposite and I hate it in a way because I‚Äôd pretty much rather be an emotional sensitive wreck than an emotionless person that keeps to themselves. Deep down I crave the feeling of love though, but I‚Äôm just scared of it all because I haven‚Äôt felt it in so long. I‚Äôm scared I am never gonna be able to let anyone in ever again and I‚Äôm gonna be lonely my whole life. I feel so far away from everything and I cannot seem to connect with anyone anymore, that‚Äôs life I guess; waiting for the day this all goes away and everything feels bright again. It‚Äôll come.",1
40,"They said they would help me when I felt like this but all I got was ‚Äústop feeling sorry for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äújust let yourself be happy‚Äù. Idk why I even open up to people, it never helps in the end. I don‚Äôt deserve their help anyway, they shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about someone like me. I just want to leave.

41,"so.. hi... im a 17 y/o guy living in southern mississippi. i have a girlfriend whos younger than me. and at first everything felt great, she made me happy. first of all some background, ive struggled with depression for almost my whole life considering i was bullied hard in elementary and middle school. the sadness strengthened its grip on my throat around freshman year of highschool because of a break up i went through, and yeah i know its stupid. but anyways after that, i lost my religion after a while and growing up in south mississippi if youre not christian youre fucked. i also eventually stopped being straight. even worse. after all this i got around 11th grade and school was fucking my life up and just making me so stressed i started having heart palpitations. okay now back to what i was gonna say before. everythings great between me and her. its just she used to make the bad thoughts go away, but now theyre back and they brought a fucking army. i just dont know what to do anymore. ive pretty much given up on ever feeling happiness again. honestly, it feels like all color is just fading away.",0

They have been home for about 2 months now, without a job, always nagging and yelling at me.I came to the realization that they know nothing about me, we‚Äô re like complete strangers.They‚Äôve missed so many important moments in my life and now it‚Äôs too late.I‚Äôm used to being alone, doing everything on my own, solving the problems I have by myself.My mom wants to ‚Äòget‚Äô me better now, but she treats me like I am 10.She hasn‚Äôt seen me grow and mature, barely knows anything about me.I even did well in school despite my depression, complete lack of motivation and ADD.I didn‚Äôt ask to be born into this shit, I wish I never was.",0

Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.",1
46,"I've been suffering from clinical depression for 6 months now and it took so much from me. I've had irregularities in my behavior ever since and obviously it took the attention of my friends. But instead of generally lifting me up, it actually made me feel worse. I've been having frequent breakdowns at school and I feel like most of my friends are getting sick and tired of me. It doesn't help that one of my friends confirmed this by telling me the last time I had a breakdown, one of my friends got upset because I still act ""this way"" even though they're trying they keep ""cheering me up"". One even just gave me advice to just ""help myself"". It feels like they think I'm using the ""I'm depressed"" as an excuse for every breakdown I have.

Yet I can't help but notice that she seems sad whenever seeing me, prob cuz I told her everything. I said her multiple times that if I'm a burden she should just forget and not talk to me like everyone else... though she denies it, I believe I am.

49,"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I don‚Äôt know if that would work or if I‚Äôd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I don‚Äôt care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I don‚Äôt want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesn‚Äôt speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to. I don‚Äôt know if he just isn‚Äôt the kind of talking person or if he doesn‚Äôt actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don‚Äôt know what and I just feel really shit and down. Am I just being stupid? Or is this something that is normal?

I don't think I'll ever find peace, even if I achieve all my dreams, it's the human condition--but I want to at least give something back to the world and live on that way, let someone carry forward my flame of hope and passion.

People just keep baling on me because they think I'm being over-dramatic, exaggerating my situation and pain... I have health problems that causes mood issues with me and sometimes I can say things or act weird. I've explained this and at first people claim to understand and will stick with me but in the end they just ignore me or some stupid argument causes a rift! I'm sick of it!

On New Years Eve, I told my boyfriend that I feel bad, that I'm wishing to have a car accident, that I just want everything to stop. He got angry, told me that I'm selfish and that I should stop with these thoughts. I would never ever kill myself, I could never do it. So no worries. I started hurting myself again, biting my arms, biting my lips. Nobody knows how I feel. Nobody. I feel alone even if I have a wonderful boyfriend and good friends.

I have several passions such as writting, video games, and cars. Butbi am not good at any of these things so it just ultimately seems ridiculous. I feel bad for my wife because I am extremely bad at expressing any emotion and mostly just hang out somewhere in the middle instead of being excited or supportive. I've felt like I'm a bit off for a long time but I have avoided seeking any help out of shame or fear. My job won't allow for me to seek mental help without transferring me and I've always been rather prideful.

112,"I'm a 22 y/o woman almost finished with my TMS therapy for my MDD. I've definitely felt the dip, and things have gotten so much better over the past few weeks. The issue I'm having though is that I feel like a completely different person. In some ways it's good, but I feel like I'm re-learning how to live. Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there. I'm very happy for the most part, and remission has been an awesome experience, but it's also terrifying. Has anyone else experienced these types of things in their remission? If so, how did you deal with it?",0
113,"For years, I have battled depression. I have battled suicidal ideations. I thought to myself, hospitalization and IOP would do the trick. Would get me out of this state. However, I realized a few days ago, maybe a week, that IOP doesn't give a shit about me. They just care about my insurance copay. I am tired. I realized that I will never get better. My life is shit. I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter? I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc... These solutions clearly don't solve the problem. Maybe this is my farewell note to the world, I don't know. I just need an exit strategy that limits the fallout. I don't want to shoot myself because that's too nuclear. I wish there was a full proof way of OD'ing. That way my family (the last vestige of people who care) would be able to see me at peace. I am Humpty Dumpty. Some things can't be repaired. Maybe that's OK and maybe that's why we have suicide.",0
114,"So, I'm medicated but not in therapy, and this is more a collection of thoughts than a coherent chain, but it's something I've been thinking about often of late. Anyway, here we go. &amp;nbsp; I want to be neurotypical. It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know? And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point. &amp;nbsp; Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed. You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy. For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option. I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless. &amp;nbsp; I want to be a whole person. I'm not motivated. There's nothing I really want from life. &amp;nbsp; ""I took the medicine, but the pills don't work, the pills they don't do anything, but rearrange all the littlest things.""

115,"Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for at least taking the time to read.",0
116,"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week. Or you think this week will be the last one. And surprisingly, when THE day comes...it goes just as it comes and you are still breathing. When do you know it's time? Well, I've been spinning in circles for a while now. Round and round and round. Joy, sadness. Over and over and over again. In my dream world, I would be happy, not angry, not sad. I would finally be able to evolve into the woman I envision myself as instead of constantly grabbing her by the cuff of her sleeve. And I would finally publish my book, and be confident in the story. Maybe even sing some songs and feel confident about it. Have a guy who will love me and cherish me. Not control me, not contact me only when he wants something, not judging me and calling me chubby. Be able to be worthy enough for the attention of this one guy in my school. I always see him. Always. But he just doesn't see me. I guess that's how it's supposed to be. With a guy who looks like an Abercrombie Fitch model and a girl who looks like she sells tomatoes for a living. A guy who has nearly a thousand followers on Instagram and a girl who just has 400.

I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me. My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done.

I didn't want any of this and I still don't but I can't end it because of earthly ties I didn't want in the first place.

We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay.

178,"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man.

Except they're rich, and beautiful, and smart and if they're not all three they're at least one of them. Me, I'm nobody. I'm a depressed person who is broke as a joke, and has nothing going on in his life. Plus I'm unemployed. I wish I could be apart of our old friend group again, I really do.

He is also my only friend. Recently I had a thought that our relationship started to become more romantic? I don't know if it's just my imagination. Now I think about him a lot. I'm straight as far as I know, also I don't feel sexually attracted to him. I don't want to lose him because of that. I'm asking for advice, I'm so confused...",0
210,"I‚Äôm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it‚Äôs driving me crazy to realize that I can‚Äôt celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don‚Äôt worry, I met them through my job, I‚Äôm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It‚Äôs just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them. I‚Äôm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can‚Äôt please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I am gay, I am a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting. I try approaching the LGBT groups on campus but I feel like they‚Äôll ostracize me for other reasons. I feel like I was cheated my teenage years by my restrictive parents, now I‚Äôm lonely and angry at everyone around me for having what I couldn‚Äôt. My siblings are successful, and I feel like the dissappointment and failure of the family. I have much more anger but these are the ones that keep popping up today, and I just wanted to vent about it somewhere.",1
211,"I thought that once I came back. That people would talk to me, that I'd be part of a group. That never happened so I feel so betrayed, like I put in so much work into myself over break to better myself and now you still won't talk to me. In reality, it was futile to begin with. Nobody would ever talk to me, I'm isolated beyond recovery. I'm destined to remain lonely.",0
212,"I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal. I often times hit a point to where I am broke every month and I talk about wishing I could just leave earth painlessly and times where I just randomly break down because I am sick of having almost no human interaction and at the age of 30 I haven't even had so much as a girlfriend. So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone. But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel ""fine"". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games. So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think). I'm really just curious on if I am considered suicidal or if I just need to find out how to not be a piece of shit at life.",0
213,"I feel nothing. I feel emotionless. My friends think that my depression is me trying to be edgy. What great friends, right? I can't write anymore. I can't draw anymore. I've opened up to my family about this but all I got was a pat on the back and a ""you'll be okay"". I feel like not even opening up to anyone anymore. How do people do this? I feel like I'm wasting my life. I'm trying to make my parents proud but they act like I'm not even here. What am I doing? Everything seems pointless. It feels like there's no hope for me anymore. I've given up on myself and so has the world. And I know what you're thinking, ""stop having a pity party. if you're so tired of feeling like this then do something about it"". And I have. I've tried every thing anyone has ever told me about getting past this or at least trying to cope with it. I'm a lost cause. I just need something, anything. How do people do this? How do I get through this before I finally and totally give up on my life and end it? What's wrong with me?",0

215,I feel like I‚Äôm not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable. This is the first time where I have been able to see the physical effects of my depression just looking at myself in the mirror. And I‚Äôm at a point where my anxiety that comes with it is so bad that I would rather not do my homework and get yelled at than even think about it. I‚Äôve never told anyone I‚Äôm depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends. I‚Äôve never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I‚Äôm 14 now and that‚Äôs my theory. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm over reacting or something I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening to my rant.,0

218,"Every single moment of my life lately has been absolute torture, and filled with mental anguish. There is not many things i'd rather do at the moment besides kill myself. The problem is that I can't for one major reason. It would completely destroy my dad, and might kill him in the process too. My father and I have a special bond that you don't find with many people nowadays; we aren't just family, we are best friends. My father is the only person I can really speak my mind to, and he has said that I am his only true friend. My father has been through some dark places lately, too. It feels like the universe won't let him keep anything good for too long. He's lost about 5 jobs over the past month, through no fault of his own. My mother and the love of his life said no to his marriage proposal and left him. His parents give him 0 encouragement for anything. I won't go into any more detail about him as I'm afraid he'll find this post by some luck, and the fact that I've been rambling. The point is that if I kill myself, that would just be one more layer on top of the shit sandwich he's had to slowly eat. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to tell somebody about this, as it's been eating me from the inside out. Does anybody have a similar experience they want to get off of their chest?",0
219,Because I do. It hurts to look at them and notice how normal they all are compared to me. And here I am. The gay one with mental issues. They don't know how lucky they are.

I have nothing left. Sometimes I feel a part of me reaching for the happiness I once new deep down. But every time it escapes me, I feel the void deepen. How long will it be until I can feel something other than complete emptiness? I can‚Äôt take much more. Thanks for listening.",0
225,I've always had an insecurity and inferior complex when it comes to my definition of success. That depression is coming back to me again and I need to let out what is bothering me. I'm seeing people younger than me get into better schools than me in harder subjects that I couldn't handle. I see people moving on much farther ahead and doing things that I haven't been able to do. I wish God could have just given me more blessings. At least have let me go to UCLA regardless of major. And yet I know that I'm so lazy and not a hard worker and I can't tell you if it's my ADHD or it's actually just me. I feel like I should know better but I don't. I feel like what is easy for others is hard for myself but other people can be so harsh and just say that it's all in your head...if you just worked hard and started just focusing on your goal then things would move forward. They make it sound so easy...and I feel like it's supposed to be easy to do but I just can't do it. And I can't decide if it's just me who thinks its hard or if it's just honestly hard for me.,1

I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode. For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it. But, is it safe to say that people without a genetic predisposition to depression's brains function (from birth) as a depressed person would function while on medication?",1

I'm only 18 so yeah doubt me all you want, but give it a few more years, and I could've seen myself with this girl for the rest of my life. Now she doesn't want to be in my life anymore and I'll never get to see her or talk to her again. How the hell am I supposed to study when I'm going to be all fucked up for a while. Its been less than 24 hours and I've just been in a drunk and stoned fuckin state functioning through my fucking day. I'm fucking snowed in alone can't even fucking talk to anybody.",0

They were nice to my face about it, but they were passing around private things I said to their friends along with pictures of me, my location, and my full name.

None of my friends that I made after this know about my struggles; I know none of them would treat me this way, but my mind refuses to listen to me.",1

But right now my depression is so bad I can barely muster the effort to even write this post. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I really want to die. I should be a freshmen in college, I had gone to UMD for a month and the depression got so bad that after a month I had to drop. I couldn‚Äôt go to classes, I felt alone, the girl I really loved was ignoring me, and I felt like I was living an entirely new life. I come home and it‚Äôs just gotten worse, everything is hard. Everyone is doing more things than me. My friends never invite me with them, I‚Äôve started smoking weed daily and I‚Äôve put on more weight (I used to be too skinny). I can barely shower or put on socks in the morning, how can I work? I didn‚Äôt even go in on New Year‚Äôs Day out of emotional pain and now I have to work tomorrow morning and I‚Äôm sitting here terrified of what will happen. I want to end up dead without the pain, or the heartbreak it leaves behind but I‚Äôm just too scared of making a mistake or what comes after. Everyday hurts. I can‚Äôt go on much longer, money is so tight and everyday just something new goes onto my plate. I‚Äôve tried a million medications with no luck, I‚Äôve attempted multiple therapists and ADT programs, nothing. I can‚Äôt work but I have to. I haven‚Äôt waken up before 4 pm in a week. It hurts.

I don't use my computer because ny phone allows me to stay in bed all the time comfortably. -my favorite hobby now is to mindlessly browse around YouTube -I don't like interaction with others.

Whenever I'm in a group of people I'm always left out and whatever I try to say something to contribute to the conversation I always get ignored. Even on Reddit if I ask for help I'm always ignored. In class I see people socializing all the time but no one has ever, ever talked to me. I guess I'm just really ugly. I wish I could be attractive so I could get some attention for once. Any ""friends"" I made in college turn out to be fake fucks who only need me for helping them with assignments or some other crap.

My friends don't seem to care at all about me, and my family doesn't understand my depression at all. Hell, I don't even know if I can understand it myself either. It's hard to articulate, but the best I can put it is that half the time, I feel like I'm just lying to myself and using depression as an excuse to be like this. My parents have always told me that I shouldn't even be depressed, considering how easy I have life compared to others, and as much as I hate to say it, I agree. As much as I really just want to fix everything, I feel like I just want to kill myself. But I can't do it. I don't know why, but I can't.

I didn't ask to be thrust into this fucking world without any say. I can't stop thinking about how life is just too painful to not be worth it at all. It's not, really. It sucks that I'd hurt so many people if I died, and it makes me angry that I have this shit holding me back from ending it all. I know they'd feel a certain way. But what about my feelings?!

And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other ""warmup"" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great.

This is the goal I have been trying to accomplish for years, the goal I never believed I would accomplish. Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me? I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.",1

Recalling events of loss, you remember voices you have once heard before this time of nothingness disappearing after their loss... Soon enough you hear the news. Am I insane? Who is this? Why is this happening? The subtle comfort of solidarity, though terrifying, luls me into comfort, still I hear this voice.... Still here alone..., where? We soon make plans. Rendezvous. Nobody cares when. We have all the time in the world right? Paris. France. That's the destination. The trip was not difficult, just long. Boats and gas are plentiful. Anyone... All two of them could break into the library now... There are so many... Finally here... I wait. Nobody. It never was... I was wrong. I have learned nothing. I still wait and look but there's nobody in sight... I guess this really is real life... I used to have this wish, and that some way, some how, I would meet her...

In a state of panic I check all my social medias to see if anyone else is still up and if they are, it usually makes me feel a lot better.

I sat down on the toilet because I felt faint, and then all I can remember is waking up on the ground inbetween the toilet and my sink, twitching. I am wondering if this could have anything to do with me taking Mirtazapine?

Recognizing this has been good for me but I still am afraid that my friendships will naturally peter out because of my own deficiencies as a person. Does this make me a bad friend?

I'm surrounded by confidence and go getters and i know deep down that i could go and try and do all of these things that i want to experience but when push comes to shove i find it impossible to justify it or sometimes even remember what it was i wanted to do.

They always somehow manage to talk me out of it but i dont u derstand why they would. My life's shit and i dont look forward to amything anymore. I really just want to die. Thats literally the only thing that would make me happy. Shouldnt they want the best for me? Why do they always keep me from being happy? And why does it work?,0
311,"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house. Idk. I just wanted to let the usual ramblings in my head out somewhere. I'm tired.",1
312,"If I could just, stop existing. I would do it in a heartbeat. But I can't... I have to commit suicide in order to do that. And even then I leave footsteps. My family would be hurt. I just wish that i was never born in the first place. Then a poor family wouldn't have to worry about me. This is one of the reasons i haven't done it yet. My girlfriend would also be very upset. I just want to go without anyone being sad about me, like I never even happened. That would be so nice",0

315,"Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that ""I hate myself"" like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or ""I want to die"". Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough? Edit: thanks for all the comments today wasn't the best day for me or week for that matter. Y'all comments made me feel a little better. Especially Mr. Wicked91 thanks, man!!!!!",1
316,"I want to die. Im not scared of death, or of what will happen, i have no one, my death wouldnt hurt anyone. But i dont want to hurt. I dont want to feel my lungs fill up with water and not be able to breathe, i dont want to feel cuts all over or a rope around my neck or anything else. It always will hurt. Thats what dying is. I dont want that. But i dont want this either. So im thinking of running away, from home, from society, from life. Maybe i could live in a remote cabin in the woods. Maybe if i had a garden and if i had to hunting, anything but this. I dont want to live this way. I know living on my own in the middle of no where is too much, its impossible to make sustainable, i couldnt get the money to even try, and even then, i cant get out of bed much less do everything. I feel hopeless, even my imagined fanatsy escapism i feel like theres no way out. Maybe suicide is the only option. Idk. I dont have any hope left, my hearts empty.",0

I fantasize about my own suicide daily. I daydream about different ways I might die/be killed. I intend to keep my promise to wait until I'm 25 even though I doubt she remembers the promise and we haven't even talked in forever, but man does life genuinely fucking suck.

319,"I'm about done here, its time for me to punch out. No friends, no career and no passion for anything. I moved from Texas to my hometown in Wisconsin because it was the last place I actually remember being happy but I've been here for a year now and nothing has changed. It's been so long now that I've felt like an entirely useless waste of space. My family doesn't even care about me anymore but I still want to write something to my mom just so she hears it from me and not a phone call by the police. I just want to apologize for all the time and money wasted on me, I turned out to be such a disappointment and I just want to be gone. I'm saving up for a neat looking revolver so I can at least go out with a bang.

320,Does anyone feel like the only person that could understand your depression would be someone else that was depressed? But also feel like if they were to date someone who was depressed they couldn't handle it because it might suck you into a place that you don't want to be in again.,0
321,"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically. The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness? Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will. So why not die?",0

I seem to have created this character, or other personality i suppose? Where i just want to fight everyone, and I won‚Äôt back down, i‚Äôm not normally a fighter and every single time i hate myself for my behaviour the day after. I guess my thinking is that if i get myself into fights, i‚Äôm going to get hurt and a part of me is hoping to be seriously injured so i can just have a break from life üôÑ Anyone else have any odd things they do during a low period?",1
325,"I have lost everything, i dont have any reason to live. Im in so much pain, its a constant unending agony. I dont want to live.

326,"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy. So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer. I called my doctor back and they sent a referral to another place, and told me I should get a call within the week. Its been 3 weeks now and no call. Im starting to think finding treatment is hopeless. And jumping through hoops just to find a potential match is just draining.",0
327,"It would be nice to hear from other people what you‚Äôre experiences have been like. When I‚Äôm on my own or with people I‚Äôm comfortable around, I‚Äôm ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. Then, when I go out in social situations, I‚Äôm someone else. I‚Äôm frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I‚Äôm socially anxious, I guess that‚Äôs the point. But I find these opposites in writing too. When I‚Äôm writing I‚Äôm intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess. Do you ever find you‚Äôre two different people?",1
328,"I hate being undesirable. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Hopefully with this new haircut I could not look as untouchable.

I got slimmer, got more muscle, haircut and all. All around, it‚Äôs a nightmare. It‚Äôs late and all I think about these hours are either suicide or imagining I am someone else. When I can, I fantasize about how my day would be different if I was a new man. I would look better, have friends, a girlfriend, a full loving and able-bodied family, nice house, etc. I guess it‚Äôs just the land of dreams for me until I die.",1
329,"My health, both mental and physical, have been going down hill since December. My life is on hold, I can't do anything, I hate feeling useless. My family yells and screams at me because I'm depressed. They call me lazy and a loser, then question why I dont talk to them about my mental health. It's the two faced nature of them that really gets to me. I'm tired of fighting everything. I have zero support, no friends, nothing but pain. I want it to end, I'm starting to plan out how I want to go. I would go to a hotel to kill myself but I dont have any money because I've been off work.

I wish for the courage to kill myself but then I think about the burden that would put on my family. I hate this world and everything about it.

While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I‚Äôm happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt why your brother is like this... he didn‚Äôt have it that bad.‚Äù My mom really doesn‚Äôt know the trauma she caused me and my brother.

I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault. He's a good person and he doesn't deserve someone ruining his happiness. today I'm preparing myself to let him go. I love him with all my heart but I cant stand it anymore. I want to get stronger but I just cant. All my friends dont know about it because I dont want to overwhelm them like how I did with him. Again, I felt alone. And I hated it. Why couldnt I be happy like 2 months ago? Why did this sadness come back? This is much stronger than what I felt for the past 11 years. Buy when the day comes where we part. I dont think I'll ever truly be myself. I made myself worse. And I just let it happen. I keep making myself worse. I hate myself for that. I really want it to work out, but maybe it's too late for that. the damage is done.",1
339,I‚Äôve reached a new point in hating myself I constantly feel as if I am worthless and not good enough.

I am not good enough for any girls because my body is disgusting and I can‚Äôt speak to them to save my life. I truly have no worth so little that my dad doesnt even love me.

340,"Life was really great but then things just completely changed and now life is just really horrible. I find myself thinking about suicide more often, and I thought about it before during a bad time, but now I‚Äôm just more sure that I‚Äôm gonna do it and I‚Äôm kind of relieved about it. I can imagine myself about to die, and I‚Äôm not as fearful as before. Anyways, I‚Äôm thinking of making a plan soon, and I‚Äôm thinking about hanging or maybe even using hydrogen sulfide (detergent suicide). If anyone knows anything about using hydrogen sulfide and any discomfort associated with it, I‚Äôd appreciate learning about it :) I‚Äôm so exhausted guys, I just wish I had someone to talk to but I feel like I just get this weird feeling that stops me from talking about it to a specific person.

341,"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself. However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have. These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference. I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me. The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",0

Sometimes I feel like I have to slit my wrists in a tub or put that bullet in my brain or swerve into a truck but I know better. It‚Äôs something in my brain that is triggering this. I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but it‚Äôs like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesn‚Äôt care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it. Maybe it‚Äôs hereditary or maybe because of the drugs she did when pregnant caused the issue with my brain? Anyway any thoughts would be helpful thank you in advance.",0

When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening. We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there. This has me so preoccupied omg.",0

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine. But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide. I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled. One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank.

Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me.

I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it.

I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much.

I hate and love him, and I was hoping that he would regret what he did to me, and help me as I helped him. But noooo. He said ""I will never forget you, but we will never see each other again"" as if I had already died. He knows I will. He acts like I'm already gone. This is so cruel and death is all I can think about, because I know that I have been a burden for my family since I was born. And I never had, nor will never have a normal and happy life.

After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.).

Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way. But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain."" I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things. Just please stop telling me I'm going to be okay, and listen to me when I say I'm not.",0

The depression or whatever, doesn't ever go away, no matter if I change my work, have money or dont, with or without romantic partners, or how my social life is doing.

By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn‚Äôt be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I‚Äôm regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it.

I'm an average student but I'm never good enough. I love art but they dont understand. They want me to be a rich doctor. That wont happen. My only talent is art, and that's it - I know it wont get me anywhere. I do nothing but disgust and disappoint. I really wish I was aborted, never born. I'm a burden, and my parents refuse therapy because it costs money and all they care about is money and my grades. They as well dont believe in mental issues. I've always been too much of a pussy to consider hurting myself, let alone, ending myself. I know I wont have a future, so why bother with going onward? I'm banal, a dead weight. I've done nothing remarkable nor contributable. If I do kill myself my parents will blame it on 'the liberal school system brainwashing me' or some shit. I just want everything to go numb forever.
